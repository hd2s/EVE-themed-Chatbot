## The Project 

This chatbot is designed to carry out conversations with users using natural language processing. It utilizes Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model capable of generating human-like responses to given prompts. The integration with Flask, a popular Python web framework, allows the creation of a web application for communication with users through a chat interface.

For the frontend of this application, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed to create a visually appealing and interactive chat interface. jQuery is used to handle the HTTP requests made to the backend server.
